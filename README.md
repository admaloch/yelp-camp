<h1>Yelp Camp Course Codealong</h1>
<h2>About this Project:</h2>
<p>This is a CRUD codealong from "The Web Developer Bootcamp" online course from Colt Steele. This project was built slowly piece by piece as a way to introduce new backend conepts in the course. This is not original code, but is a fairly accurate indicator of my comfort level with back-end concepts and I intend to solidify these concepts later in some personal projects.  </p>
<h2>Concepts:</h2>
Some of these concepts covered in this project are setting up servers with express, html templating with ejs, setting up a DB with Mongo DB and interacting with it using Mongoose, RESTFul routing, Express and Mongoose middleware, validating data, session storage, flash, authentication, authorization and security.
